# NaSH
## A useless shell, for learning purposes

This shell implements some features from zsh, some from fish, and some from bash for the sake of learning Rust. This shell _really_ shouldn't be used by anyone over any of the aforementioned shells since it's just a project used to practice learning the language Rust.
This shell somewhat acts like a typical Unix shell, and as a result I'm not really sure how it would behave on Windows. Sorry!

NaSH is a portmanteau of "Nate" and "SHell", really not that clever but I thought it had a nice ring to it.
